# AI-ML Price Prediction for Agri-Horticultural Commodities

## Problem Statement

**Title:** Development of AI-ML based models for predicting prices of agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses and vegetables (onion, potato, etc.)

The Department of Consumer Affairs monitors the daily prices of 22 essential food commodities through 550 price reporting centers across the country. The Department also maintains buffer stock of pulses (gram, tur, urad, moong, and masur), and onion for strategic market interventions to stabilize the volatility in prices. Decisions for market interventions, such as the release of stocks from the buffer, are taken based on price trends and outlook. Currently, price analyses are based on seasonality, historical and emerging trends, market intelligence inputs, crop sowing, and production estimates. ARIMA-based economic models have also been used to examine and forecast prices of pulses.

## Project Overview

This project implements an LSTM-based deep learning model to forecast prices of agri-horticultural commodities using historical time-series data. The model captures long-term dependencies and seasonal patterns to generate accurate predictions, assisting policymakers in price monitoring and effective market intervention planning.
